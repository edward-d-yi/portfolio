                <p>
                    Originally, digital devices were conceptualized to serve a practical purpose. However, the digital
                    space our devices have ascended beyond just utility. Rather, it has become a digital place. People
                    “go” on their computers or “visit” a website, they are not simply used as tools. Virtual pets were
                    conceived as videogames. However, games are not where users spend most of their time: it's really on
                    the desktop. In this digital place, what kinds of digital inhabitants could occupy it? There are a
                    range of possibilities from desktop assistants (e.g. Clippy) to desktop companions (e.g. Shimeji)
                    and even malware posed as desktop assistants (e.g. BonziBuddy). Our project will be focused on
                    desktop pets: virtual pets that reside on the desktop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michitop is a <b>systems-for-a-study</b> paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the lack of research on desktop pets, we will outline a definition and criteria for what
                    constitutes a desktop pet versus a virtual pet. We will also be developing two types of desktop
                    pets: one that has more interaction, more presence and asks for more of the user's attention
                    (<b>companion mode</b>) whilst the other has less presence (<b>aesthetic mode</b>). The participants
                    for this
                    study will be given one of these two desktop pet models (called a “Michitop”) to use on their
                    desktop for at least 5 days. Afterwards, a post-use survey will be sent asking for feedback
                    regarding their experience with the desktop pet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the survey results, we will derive:

                <p>
                    (1) What kind of value can a desktop pet add to the user experience?
                </p>
                <p>
                    (2) How do different interactions change the user experience, such as perceived presence or
                    emotional attachment?
