                    <b>Introduction / Motivation</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rise of streaming services and their focus on “bingeable” content has reshaped the entertainment
                    industry. One visible result is the shortening of TV seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2023, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, partly to protest a years-long trend: American
                    TV series releasing fewer episodes per season, reducing pay for writers. We set out to confirm or
                    challenge this claim, recognizing that its implications go beyond the industry. The trend may
                    reflect shifting audience attention spans and broader cultural and economic changes in how media is
                    created and consumed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We hypothesize that the dominance of streaming platforms, especially Netflix, has pushed both the
                    industry and many audiences toward shorter episodes and seasons.

                    Our approach was modeled after visual essays from <a href="https://pudding.cool/" target="_blank"

                <p>
                    <b>Methodology</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To evaluate our hypotheses about shrinking season lengths and changing viewer behavior, we analyzed
                    the issue from three perspectives: critics, networks, and consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the critics' angle, we focused on Emmy winners in Drama and Comedy, using a scatter plot to
                    track how episode counts of winning series changed over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For networks, we created a stacked bar graph showing the distribution of Emmy-winning and nominated
                    shows by platform, again in Drama and Comedy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the consumer side, we used a multi-line graph and a time series plot to explore whether
                    shorter, often cheaper-to-produce seasons correlated with higher viewership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Netflix data spans 2021-2025, a period marked by major shifts in production and distribution.
                    Data about series, seasons, and episode lengths came from TMDB and covers 2000-2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Design</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inspired by narrative data projects, we explored production trends through a storytelling lens. To
                    humanize large-scale data, we incorporated social media posts about season lengths and used
                    scrollytelling and interactivity to boost engagement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our initial visualization used a bubble plot linked to a line graph of average episode counts by
                    year and country. Feedback showed these were too cluttered and hard to interpret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In response, we simplified our visuals: a scatter plot for critics, a stacked bar graph for
                    networks, and a time series chart for consumers. These clearer formats better conveyed the
                    perspectives of critics, networks, and viewers. Some visuals, like the scatter plot, also invite
                    users to explore the data themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Implementation</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pulled show metadata from the TMDB (<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Movie Database</a>) API and sourced Netflix's top
                    10 shows from their site. To manage computational limits, we used a GitHub Actions script to fetch
                    and store data in our repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We cleaned the data using Python's pandas and built early visuals with matplotlib. Final
                    visualizations were built in D3.js and embedded in a digital essay format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Discussion</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feedback on our revised visuals was largely positive. Viewers found them clearer and more readable
                    than earlier versions. Some still found the overall message unclear, so we reorganized the essay to
                    foreground key insights, especially how the industry-wide shift to shorter seasons appears in both
                    critical and consumer data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our analysis confirmed several patterns. TV seasons have shortened over time, particularly on
                    platforms like Netflix and Hulu. While cost-effective for the industry, this raises a key question:
                    how do viewers feel?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Netflix viewership data revealed notable trends. Very short seasons (under 6 episodes) tended to
                    have lower global viewership. Longer seasons (over 15 episodes) also showed a drop in normalized
                    viewership, suggesting audiences may lose interest when seasons drag on. A sweet spot emerged at
                    8-10 episodes, as these seasons consistently had the highest normalized viewership per episode and
                    consistently hit Netflix's top ten most watched shows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Future Work</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see several directions to expand this project. First, sentiment analysis on platforms like
                    Twitter and Reddit could reveal emotional responses, nostalgia, frustration, or satisfaction, toward
                    shorter seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, expanding our TMDB dataset to include international series could help determine whether this
                    trend is uniquely American or global.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, refining the structure and layout of our digital essay could improve clarity and
                    engagement. Stronger alignment between visuals and narrative, clearer takeaways, and better
                    interactivity would enhance impact.
