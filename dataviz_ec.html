                    <b>Redesign Methodology</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    My approach to redesigning this visualization focused on making the information more easily
                    digestible, enhancing the communication of the narrative elements in these films in a way that is
                    more visually intuitive for viewers and users, while ensuring it remained feasible within the scope
                    of my current skills and the time available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Writeup / Critique</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I noticed that the original visualization lacked source material for the data, which I had to
                    compile manually using a text file and then appropriately convert for use in the redesign. What
                    stood out to me most during this process, particularly while breaking down the narrative segments
                    (dialogue, training, montages, pre-fight, fight, and credits), was how misleading the information
                    could be when users interact with the visual. For example, certain segments differentiated by color
                    often overlapped with others they were meant to distinguish from, leading to potential confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on Donald Norman's guidance on the representation of numbers, I also felt that using Arabic
                    numerals instead of Roman numerals to identify the films would make the visualization more
                    immediately understandable to users. If I had more time, I would incorporate additional interactive
                    features tailored to the data in order to further enhance user experience and comprehension of the
                    visual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the redesigned visualization, it's immediately clear that the 'Dialogue' segment consistently
                    dominates the narrative structure and comprises the majority of the runtime across all the films.
                    Another compelling insight revealed through the redesign is the gradual decline in ratings for the
                    sequels over time, except for the final film, Rocky VI, which was surprisingly rated nearly as high
                    as the second installment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the redesign is less complex than the original, I believe it is more visually accessible,
                    avoids overwhelming the viewer, and effectively communicates the core information that users are
                    likely seeking. The addition of tooltip-based interactivity allows users to explore further details
                    at their discretion. This revised data visualization aims to present the narrative elements of each
                    Rocky movie in a way that is clear, accessible, and relevant, making it easier for viewers to engage
                    with and interpret the data without unnecessary effort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Redesign Guidelines:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Choose a published visualization (general media or academic) and redesign it to improve the
                    communication. Include a writeup with your critique of the original and the rationale behind your
                    modifications. Your redesign should be structurally significant, and not merely adding a few labels
                    or touch-ups. Consider: how might you redesign for a different audience? with a more thorough or
                    more descriptive dataset? to prioritize a different message? to change the narrative structure? Make
                    sure you read <a href="https://medium.com/@hint_fm/design-and-redesign-4ab77206cf9#.mha4ohu1t"
