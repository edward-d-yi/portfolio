                        <b>Theme:</b> Social Good on Campus
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Problem Statement:</b> I often find it difficult to choose which dining hall or dish to eat
                        at on
                        campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the menu showcases available dishes, it doesn't provide any feedback on taste,
                        quality, or overall appeal, leaving me unsure whether the meal will meet my expectations, or
                        taste good or not. To get more information on a dish, I mostly rely on my friends'
                        recommendations to guide my choices. I wish there was a centralized source to help me make
                        informed decisions based on community feedback, enhancing my overall dining hall experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our most promising design solution is a platform for a user interface that acts as a menu display
                        for the dining halls at
                        Columbia University and a database for reviews of certain dishes at the dining halls. </p>

                            To better understand our target population and the current issues with the dining experience
                            at Columbia (as stated in the problem statement), we conducted a contextual inquiry
                            by observing and interviewing 4+ different people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From this set of interviews, we learned/verified that:

                            <p>3. When trying to decide what dining hall to go to, the current interface can lack

                            Utilizing the data we collected from the contextual inquiry, my team and I organized an
                            affinity diagram to synthesize all our findings into broader common themes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We started this process by noting down all our general findings and comments made by our
                            participants during our observations and interviews on the <b class="yellow">yellow</b>
                            post-it notes.

                        <p>
                            Then we grouped them into categories and wrote a summary label for each cluster on the <b

                        <p>
                            From there, we grouped those clusters into broader common themes and labeled each
                            one on the <b class="red">red</b> post-its.

                            Although screens show what the user sees, they cannot show what the user thinks or feels. In
                            other words, screens don't tell the story. Humans
                            are wired to make sense of the world through stories.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this phase of our project, we created a journey map to tell the story by highlighting key
                            moments (highest point, lowest point, and major transitions) to guide us in getting the
                            right
                            design for our design solution.

                        <p>
                            Our journey map illustrates the user's entire experience in a simple, actionable chart and
                            identifies the most promising opportunities to improve the user's journey.

                            To brainstorm different design solutions or 'hills' to address our problem statement, every
                            team

                            Storyboards are what allow us to communicate design ideas in a simple and engaging way. But
                            unlike journey maps, storyboards shine when illustrating a solution concept (not just a
                            status quo experience).

                            The storyboard above/on the left is the latest idea that most closely emulates our design
                            solution for the final product: an interface that acts as a menu display for the dining
                            halls at
                            Columbia and a database for reviews of certain dishes at the dining halls.

                            through smoke-and mirrors prototype(s).

                        <p>
                            When testing our solution concept, our team wanted to mainly focus on determining whether
                            users
                            would actually provide data for Columbia dining hall dishes with star reviews
                            and ratings, and whether they would find the information we compiled from these
                            responses useful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our team collected reviews and dining information using a Google Form, which we used to
                            populate our “database” of dining hall reviews. To gather a large amount of data, we printed
                            and
                            posted flyers around campus, particularly in areas near the dining halls. We
                            also promoted CU Eats by sharing the Google Form in group chats and directly messaging
                            individual users.

                            We created low-fidelity prototypes to test basic functionality and gather initial user
                            feedback.

                        <p>
                            This helped us refine our approach before moving on to more detailed (high-fidelity)
                            designs.
